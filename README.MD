This app gets its source of notices from a Python and Flask server which I have deployed on Heroku. That server scrapes IP University's website every minute and updates the FireBase database and also sends a notification to the user if any new notice is found. The app provides the user with a fast and smooth experience filled with subtle animations and minimal design.
